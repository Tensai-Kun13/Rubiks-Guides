# CFOP Method (Coming Soon!) 🚀

Hello little cube explorer! 🧊

You're about to enter the world of **speedcubing** — where cubes are solved faster than lightning! ⚡ But hold on tight... we're still getting this part of the guide ready for you.

The **CFOP Method** is a super cool way to solve the Rubik’s Cube like the pros do. It has four magical steps:

- **C**ross  
- **F**irst Two Layers  
- **O**rient the Last Layer  
- **P**ermute the Last Layer  

Sounds fancy, right? Don’t worry, we’ll break it down into bite-sized, super simple stories just like before! 📖✨

In the meantime, if you haven’t already, make sure to explore the **Beginner’s Method** and **Cube Basics** to get ready for the CFOP adventure.

More cube magic coming soon... stay tuned! 🧙‍♂️🧊
