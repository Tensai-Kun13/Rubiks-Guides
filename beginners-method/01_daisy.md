# Step 1: Create the Daisy 🌼

"Imagine you're planting a flower garden, and your goal is to grow a beautiful daisy on top of your Rubik’s Cube. The yellow center is the heart of the flower, and you need to place four white petals (edges) around it."
Finding the White Petals

🔍 First, let’s find the white edges. They might be anywhere—hiding in the middle, stuck at the bottom, or already in the right place!

📌 Case 1: White edge is in the middle layer (Good!)

    If the white edge is on the right, turn the right side up (R) to place it near the yellow center.
    If the white edge is on the left, turn the left side up (L') to do the same.

📌 Case 2: White edge is in the top layer (Uh-oh!)

    If the white part is sticking out forward, give the front face a little turn CW (F) or CCW (F') to send it down to the middle.
    Now it's in Case 1, so just move it up (R or L').

📌 Case 3: White edge is in the bottom layer (Also bad!)

    If the white part is sticking forward, do the same as before: turn the front CW (F) or CCW (F') to bring it up.
    Now it's in Case 1, so move it into place.

📌 Case 4: White edge is stuck on the bottom face (The worst!)

    This means the white part is facing straight down.
    Give the front face a double turn (F2) to send it all the way to the top.

Special Cases: Daisy Troubles

🌼 Sometimes, the daisy is already partially done, and adding a new petal might mess things up!

⚠️ Special Case 1: You’re about to kick out an already placed petal

    Before moving a new white edge up, rotate the top layer (U') to make space.
    Now, move the white edge into place like Case 1.

⚠️ Special Case 2: A bad edge would lead to Special Case 1

    If a white edge is stuck in a bad position (top or bottom), first give the front face a single turn (F or F') to set up Special Case 1.
    Then, follow the steps from Special Case 1 to fix it!

🌟 Your Daisy is Ready!

"Once you’ve placed all four white petals around the yellow center, you’ve grown a perfect daisy. Nice work!" 🎉
