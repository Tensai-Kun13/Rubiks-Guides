# 🌼 Step 1: Make the Daisy

Once upon a time, your Rubik’s Cube wanted to become a flower garden. But not just any flower — it dreamed of becoming a daisy, with a bright yellow middle and four little white petals all around! 🌞🌼

Let’s help it grow, one petal at a time.

## 🌟 The Daisy's Dream

Look at the top of your cube — the yellow center is the daisy’s heart. Now we need to find four white **edge pieces** (the ones between two centers, not corners!) and bring them up to sit around the yellow center, like petals.

These special pieces are called **white petals**, and our goal is to gently guide each one up to the top face to form the daisy.

## 🌼 How to Help the White Petals

The white edge pieces might be hiding all over the cube. Some may already be on the top, others might be on the sides or even the bottom! Your job is to gently move them up next to the yellow center.

If a white edge is already on the top but not in the right spot, don’t worry—you can spin the top face until it's out of the way. Then, bring in a new white edge to take its place. If a white edge is hiding at the bottom, turn that face so it's under an empty spot on the top, then turn that face 180° to send it up to the top like a rocket ship! 🚀

Be careful not to flip any corners or twist the cube too much. Keep it steady and make those petals bloom!

## 🔍 Where Are the Petals Hiding?

White petals love to play hide-and-seek! Let’s find them and help them reach the top. Here’s how they like to hide — from easiest to trickiest:

### 🌟 Best Place: On Top Already  
If a white petal is already on the top face next to the yellow center — yay! It's already part of the daisy. No moving needed.

### 👍 Second Best: In the Middle of a Side  
If the white petal is in the **middle row of any side**, just turn that face **upward** to pop it onto the daisy!

It’s like giving the petal a little elevator ride to its sunny spot. ☀️🌼

### 😅 Third Best: On the Bottom  
If the white petal is on the **very bottom** of the cube, it needs a super bounce:
1. Turn the bottom layer until the petal is under an empty daisy spot.
2. Then turn that face **twice** (180°) to flip it straight up.

Boing! Just like a trampoline launch! 🦘⬆️⬆️

### 🙈 Tricky Ones: On the Face but in the Top or Bottom Row  
These petals are a little confused — they’re on the **face** of the cube, but not in the middle row. Their white side is facing you, and they’re in either the **top** or **bottom** row of that face.

Here’s a little gardening trick:
- Don’t try to send these directly to the daisy.
- Instead, turn that face **clockwise** or **counterclockwise** until the white part moves into the **middle row**.

Now it’s in the second-best spot, and you can turn it up like usual! 🌼💫

## 🌼 Little Gardener Tips

- Work only with **edge pieces** that have white on them (not corners).
- It’s okay to ignore the other colors for now — we’re just building the daisy!
- If a petal is being tricky, try turning the cube or face to get a better view.

## ✅ Did You Make the Daisy?

Look at the yellow center on top. Do you see four white petals around it? If yes — hooray! You helped your cube bloom its first flower. 🌼💛
