# ✝️ Step 2: Solve the White Cross

Once upon a time, the Daisy bloomed proudly at the top of the cube, its four white petals smiling around the yellow center. But these petals had a dream—they wanted to grow into a beautiful white cross on the bottom of the cube, where the white center lives. 🌼➡️✝️

Now it’s time to help each white petal find its home. But this isn’t just any home—it has to match the color on the other side of the petal with the center color of that face.

___

## 🌈 The Great Petal Spin

Make sure you are hold your cube with the Daisy is on top and look closely at one of the white petals. Peek at the color that’s not white (maybe it’s red, blue, green, or orange). Then, spin the top face (where the Daisy lives) until that color lines up with its matching center color. Like magic, red finds red, blue finds blue... they just want to go home!

___

## ⬇️ Send It Down

Once the petal is lined up with the matching color, gently turn that whole face 180° so the white petal moves from the top all the way down to the bottom.

It’s like the petal hops on an elevator, spins around, and lands on the white center’s floor with a happy *thunk*! 🎉 Now it’s not just any white piece—it’s part of the white cross!

Repeat this with each white petal until all four are at the bottom, and their side colors are hugging their matching centers.

## ✝️ What You’re Making

Now you’ve built something really special! On the white face (now at the bottom), there’s a big white “plus” sign. And guess what? Each arm of that plus sign is perfectly matched with its color on the side too.

Your Daisy has blossomed into a full White Cross! ✨ Great job, little cuber! Let’s keep going—the cube has many more stories to tell.
