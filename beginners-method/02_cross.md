# Step 2: Solve the Cross ✝️  

**Goal:**  
We will turn the daisy into a **white cross on the bottom** by aligning and flipping the edges.  

## 📝 Steps  

### 1️⃣ Align the Edge  
- Find a **white edge piece** (e.g., **white/red**).  
- Turn the **top layer (U or U')** until the non-white color (red) matches its center.  

### 2️⃣ Flip It Down  
- Rotate the **matched face 180° (F2)** to move the white piece to the bottom.  

### 3️⃣ Repeat for All 4 Edges  
- Do this for all white edges.  
- Double-check that each is aligned before flipping!  

🎉 **Congrats! The white cross is solved!** 🎉
