# Step 8: Orient the Yellow Corners

The yellow corners are finally sitting in their right spots — hooray! 🎉 But uh-oh… some of them are still *twisted* the wrong way. Let’s help each one stand up straight with their yellow hats on top.

---

## 🧠 What’s the Goal?

Make sure that **each corner shows yellow on top**. No more sideways or upside-down yellow — we want a full, sunny yellow face shining proudly at the top! ☀️

> It’s like helping four sleepy sunflowers turn their heads up to the sunshine.

---

## 🔄 Time to Flip the Cube!

First, we need to do a little cube gymnastics.

Flip the whole cube upside down so the **white face is now on top**, and the **yellow face is on the bottom**.

> Don’t worry, yellow will shine again soon — we’re just helping it from the bottom up!

---

## 🎭 Solving the Corners One by One

Now it’s time to meet each twisted corner, one at a time.

Look at the **bottom layer** (which used to be the top!). Find a corner that still needs help — one that doesn’t have yellow facing down.

Hold the cube so that this corner is in the **bottom-right corner** (the "Down-Right" spot).

## 💃 The Dance That Fixes It All

To help the corner twist the right way, we’ll use a special little dance called the **Super Move**.

Here’s how it goes:
⬆ `R` ⬅ `U` ⬇ `R'` ➡ `U'`

Do the dance **over and over** (don’t turn the cube!) until the yellow sticker appears on the bottom — that means the corner is solved!

> It's like a little spin-a-roo until the yellow pops into place. You’ll see it happen like magic! 🪄

---

## 🔁 Move to the Next Corner

Now turn just the **bottom layer** (not the whole cube!) to bring another unsolved corner to the **Down-Right** spot.

Repeat the same Super Move dance until that corner is solved too.

> Keep going around the cube, one sleepy corner at a time, until all the yellow corners are facing down.

### 🎊 You Did It!

☀️ *The sun is shining, the yellow face is smiling, and all the corners are standing tall!*  
You’ve finished the very last twisty-turny part of the puzzle.
