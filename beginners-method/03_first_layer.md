# 🧩 Step 3: Solve the First Layer (White Corners)

The white daisy has bloomed, and the cross is sparkling at the bottom. Now it's time to invite the white corner pieces to join the party and finish the first layer!

These little corner pieces have three colors on them, and they’re hiding in the top layer—just waiting for you to help them find their perfect place.

## 🔍 Finding the White Corners

Look at the top layer of the cube. You’ll see some corner pieces with little white stickers on them—these are the ones we want to help! They want to move down to the bottom, right between the two colored walls that match their sides.

Now, sometimes the white part is peeking up at you from the top. Other times, it's hiding on the side, or even stuck in a twisty jail! But don’t worry—we’ve got special moves for every case.

## 🕺 Meet the “Super Move” and Friends

There's a special dance that helps white corners move to the bottom. It's called the **Super Move**, and it goes like this:

**⬆️ R ⬅️ U ⬇️ R' ➡️ U'**

It might sound silly, but it works like magic!

And there’s also a partner move called the **Left Super Move**:

**⬆️ L' ➡️ U' ⬇️ L ⬅️ U**

They both do the same kind of magic, just on different sides of the cube.

## 🎯 How to Solve the Corners

Most of the time, the white corner piece will be sitting in the top layer, either on the right side or the left.

Let’s say the white sticker is on the **right side** of the piece (like this: `[A] [A] [W]`). That means you should gently turn the cube so that piece is sitting in the **top-right corner**, then use the **Right Super Move**.

Now imagine the white sticker is on the **left side** of the piece (like this: `[W] [A] [A]`). You’d turn the cube so that piece is in the **top-left corner**, and use the **Left Super Move**.

Every time you do one of these moves, the piece gets closer to its happy home. You might have to do the move once, twice, or even three times—but eventually, it’ll slide into the right spot.

## 💡 When White Is on Top

Sometimes the white sticker is looking straight up at you from the top of the piece. In this case, you can just do **the Right or Left Super Move three times**. It might look like a dance, but by the end, the piece will twirl right into place.

## 🚔 What If a Corner Is “In Jail”?

Uh-oh! One of your white corner pieces might already be in the right spot… but it's twisted the wrong way. That means it’s **“in jail.”**

Here’s a secret: to get it out, you first make sure the white sticker is on the **side**, not on the bottom. Then, you do the super move that matches the side the white sticker is on (Right Super Move for the right side, Left Super Move for the left). That will kick it out of jail and back up to the top layer, where you can solve it normally using the moves you’ve already learned.

## 🎉 Hooray!

Once all four white corners are in place, the entire white face will be smiling up at you! The first layer will be complete, with matching sides all around like a strong and colorful foundation. 🧱🌈
