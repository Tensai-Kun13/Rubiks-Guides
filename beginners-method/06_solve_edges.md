# Step 6: Solve the Yellow Edges

The white face is smiling at the bottom, and the first two layers are tucked in just right — but now, the yellow face on top looks a little grumpy! Let’s cheer it up by helping the yellow edge pieces find their right spots so they match the center colors on the sides.

## 🌼 The Goal

We want to make a bright yellow cross on the top face — but not just any cross! The yellow edges should *also* match the color of the center pieces on each side. So if there’s a yellow-blue edge, it should sit between the yellow and blue centers.

Once all four yellow edge pieces are happy in their homes, we’ll have a glowing yellow cross that matches the world around it!

## 🔍 Finding Our Starting Clues

Look at the yellow face. Sometimes, two of the yellow edge pieces are already in the right spot — lucky us! But they might be:

- **Opposite** from each other (like blue and green)
- Or **next to each other** (like red and blue)

If you get **two opposite edges correct**, you’ll want to do our magical move — the **Sune** — from anywhere.

If two **adjacent edges** are correct, turn the cube so those two happy pieces are on the **right** and **back**. That’s their comfy place while we fix the rest.

## 🧙‍♂️ The Magical Sune Spell

Let me tell you the story of **Sune**, the yellow-edge wizard! He carries a special corner and edge pair in his bag, and when he sees edges out of place, he knows just what to do.

First, he gently takes a pair out of the **front-right** of the cube with ⬆️ ⬅️ ⬇️ — that’s `R U R'`. Then, he **hides the pair in the back** with another ⬅️ turn (`U`). Next, he lifts the **home spot** up with ⬆️ (`R`), and uses two quick turns (`U2`) to bring the pair right back in. Finally, he lowers the home (`R'`) to close everything up neatly.

It sounds like magic, but here’s the full spell:

**Sune Algorithm**  
⬆️ `R` ⬅ `U` ⬇ `R'` ⬅ `U` ⬆ `R` ⬅⬅ `U2` ⬇`R'`

Sometimes you’ll need to do this spell **once**, sometimes **twice** — just like tapping a wand until the sparkles settle. When you're done, all the yellow edge pieces will be in their perfect places, hugging their matching centers.

🧙‍♂️ *"Poof! With a little magic, all the yellow edge pieces are home — your cross is now truly complete!"*
