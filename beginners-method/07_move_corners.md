# Step 7: Move the Yellow Corners

Uh-oh! The yellow corners are being a little silly. They’re sitting in the wrong spots, even if they’re yellow on top! It’s time to kindly help each corner find its perfect little home.

## 🧠 What’s the Goal?

We want **each yellow corner** to sit in **the right spot**, even if it’s not facing the right way just yet.

> Picture this: The yellow-red-blue corner should be snuggled between the yellow, red, and blue center pieces — even if yellow isn’t showing on top yet. Once every corner is *in the right place*, we’ll worry about twisting them later!

## 🔍 Look For a Corner That’s Already in the Right Spot

Before we do anything, check if **any** of the yellow corners are already in the correct spot (matching the colors around them).

- If you find one, yay! Hold the cube so that this good corner is in the **front left**.
- If **none** are in the right spot, that’s okay too — just hold the cube any way and we’ll fix it.

## 🧙‍♂️ The Niklas Trick (A Little Story)

Once upon a time, there were **two corner pieces** that were best friends — one on the **right**, and one on the **left**.

The corner on the right wanted to visit the back of the cube, so we helped him move with a *right turn* ⬆️ and a little *U' slide* ➡️. Then the corner on the left said, “Hey! Me too!” so we gave him a *left turn* ⬆ and slide *U* back ⬅️.

But wait — now the corner on the right wanted to come home. So we helped him with a *right prime* ⬇️ and another *U'* ➡️. Finally, the left friend got to come home too with a *left prime* ⬇.

And just like that — they swapped places nicely!

Here’s the magic spell, just in case:
⬆️ `R` ➡️ `U'` ⬆️ `L'` ⬅️ `U` ⬇️ `R'` ➡️ `U'` ⬇️ `L`

> ✨ You might need to do the magic once or twice to get all the corners into their right homes!

## 🧩 Check Again

After the Niklas move, take a look:

- If only **one corner** is correct now, turn the cube so that it’s in the **front left**, and do the magic again.
- Keep going until *all four* yellow corners are sitting in the right spots.

> Don’t worry if yellow isn’t showing yet — we’ll twist them in the next step!
