# Step 4: Solve the Second Layer 🧱

Now that you’ve built the bottom floor of your cube kingdom — with its white cross and happy corners — it’s time to help the **second floor** get built! This part is all about moving the middle-edge pieces into their perfect homes 🏡.

## 🧩 What Are We Looking For?

You’re searching for edge pieces that live in the **middle** of the cube — the ones without yellow on them. These edge pieces need to move from the top layer (the roof) down to the middle layer (the second floor), so they can sit between the right two center colors.

Each of these edge pieces has **two colors**, and when they’re in the right spot, they’ll match the colors of the two walls next to them.

## ✨ A Magic Trick to Move Edges

Let’s say you find a special little edge piece sitting on the top layer. It's not wearing a yellow hat (so it’s not part of the top), and it has two colors—just like a buddy trying to find the two rooms it belongs between.

The trick to help it is called the **Edge Switcheroo**. It’s like a secret tunnel the piece goes through to slide into its cozy spot.

First, you help it face the right way by spinning the top so one of its colors matches the center below it. Then, you turn the top layer *away* from where the piece wants to go. This hides the piece—shhh! 🤫 It’s part of the trick.

Now, if the piece wants to go to the **right**, you do the **Right Super Move**. If it wants to go to the **left**, you do the **Left Super Move**.

But wait! The trick isn’t over yet. You give the cube a gentle turn so the other color’s home (the matching center) is now in front of you. Then you do the **other** super move on that side, and ta-da! ✨ The edge slides right into place.

## 😬 What If There Are No Good Edges?

Oh no! Sometimes all the edge pieces on top are wearing yellow hats. That means none of them are ready to move in yet. But don’t worry—we can fix that!

Pick any of the yellow-headed edge pieces and **pretend** it’s the one you want. Do the whole edge trick with it anyway! It won’t solve anything right away, but what it will do is **kick out** a real piece (one with no yellow) from the second layer and pop it up to the top. That way, you’ll have a good piece to work with on your next turn.

You’re not making a mistake—you’re just making room for the right piece. Kind of like bumping the wrong puzzle piece out so the right one can fit!

## 🧠 Helpful Reminder

Always make sure you're not putting yellow-edge pieces into the second layer *on purpose*. They're not meant to be there! Only use them to bump out the good ones when you need to.

## 🍰 When You’re Done

Once you’ve helped all the correct edges move into their second-layer homes, your cube will have a beautiful bottom two layers—like a double-decker cake, neat and colorful all the way around. 🎂💖
