## Cube Basics

Before we dive into solving methods, let’s familiarize ourselves with the Rubik's Cube anatomy and terminology.

### Cube Anatomy

The Rubik's Cube consists of **26 smaller pieces**:
- **8 corners**: Each corner has 3 colored stickers.
- **12 edges**: Each edge has 2 colored stickers.
- **6 fixed center pieces**: The centers are fixed and represent the color of each face.

The cube moves by rotating these smaller pieces around a core, which allows for different configurations.

## Cube Notation

In order to understand the moves you need to make, you need to learn the **notation**. Each move is represented by a letter, and the direction of the turn is important.

### Notation Key:

- **R**: Right face clockwise
- **R'**: Right face counter-clockwise
- **L**: Left face clockwise
- **L'**: Left face counter-clockwise
- **U**: Up face clockwise
- **U'**: Up face counter-clockwise
- **D**: Down face clockwise
- **D'**: Down face counter-clockwise
- **F**: Front face clockwise
- **F'**: Front face counter-clockwise
- **B**: Back face clockwise
- **B'**: Back face counter-clockwise

A **2** after a letter means a 180-degree turn (e.g., **R2** means turning the right face 180 degrees).

## Face Names

The cube has 6 faces, each associated with a specific color (usually):

- **U**: Up face (typically white)
- **D**: Down face (typically yellow)
- **F**: Front face (typically blue)
- **B**: Back face (typically green)
- **R**: Right face (typically red)
- **L**: Left face (typically orange)

Knowing the face names helps you follow algorithms and understand instructions more easily.

## Beginner's Method

The **Beginner's Method** is a step-by-step solving method designed for new solvers. It’s easy to learn and gives you a simple solution to solve the cube in around 2 minutes once you get comfortable.

### Step 1: Solve the White Cross

Start by solving the **white cross** on the white face of the cube. This involves positioning the white edge pieces so that the white stickers form a plus sign.

**Algorithm for White Cross**:
1. Position the white edges above the white center piece.
2. Rotate the edges so that each one matches the color of the adjacent center pieces.

### Step 2: Solve the White Corners

Next, solve the **white corners** to complete the white face.

**Algorithm for White Corners**:
- **R' D' R D** (repeat until the corner is in the correct position).

### Step 3: Solve the Middle Layer Edges

Once the white face is done, solve the edges of the middle layer.

**Algorithm for Edge Pieces**:
- **U R U' R' U' F' U F** (for edge pieces on the upper layer).

### Step 4: Solve the Yellow Cross

After finishing the middle layer, move on to solving the **yellow cross** on the opposite face (yellow).

### Step 5: Solve the Yellow Corners

Next, solve the yellow corners to complete the yellow face.

### Step 6: Finish the Cube

Finally, you will need to orient the yellow corners and solve the last layer edges. This step involves applying algorithms until the entire cube is solved.

## CFOP Method

The **CFOP Method** is a more advanced solving method used by speedcubers. It’s faster than the Beginner's Method, and it’s based on four steps:

### Step 1: Cross

Start by solving the **cross** on the white face, similar to the Beginner's Method. However, in CFOP, you'll try to position the edge pieces efficiently to minimize moves.

### Step 2: F2L (First Two Layers)

Solve the first two layers simultaneously. This step involves pairing up corner and edge pieces and inserting them into their correct positions in one move.

**Algorithm for F2L**:
- Various algorithms depending on the position of the pair.

### Step 3: OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)

After completing the first two layers, solve the last layer's orientation. This step requires memorizing multiple algorithms to orient all pieces correctly.

**Example OLL Algorithm**:
- **R U2 R' U' R U' R' U2 R** (for specific cases).

### Step 4: PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)

Finally, you’ll permute the last layer to complete the cube. This step involves using algorithms to move the last layer pieces into their correct spots.

**Example PLL Algorithm**:
- **R2 U' R' U' R U R' U R U' R' U' R2** (for specific PLL cases).
