### 🦴 Cube Anatomy

Your cube is made of **26 little puzzle pieces**:
- **Corners**: 8 of them, each with 3 colors.
- **Edges**: 12 in total, each with 2 colors.
- **Centers**: 6 fixed friends in the middle of each face that never move!

These pieces twist and turn around a magical invisible ball inside. 🎱

### 💃 Cube Notation

Cubes love to dance! We use special letters to tell them how to move. Here's how we talk to our cube:

- **R / R'**: Right face turns (clockwise / counter-clockwise)
- **L / L'**: Left face turns
- **U / U'**: Up face turns
- **D / D'**: Down face turns
- **F / F'**: Front face turns
- **B / B'**: Back face turns

A **2** after a letter means a big spin: a 180° turn! (Like R2)

Each side of the cube has a name, and they usually match colors:

- **U (Up)**: Usually white
- **D (Down)**: Usually yellow
- **F (Front)**: Usually blue
- **B (Back)**: Usually green
- **R (Right)**: Usually red
- **L (Left)**: Usually orange

Knowing these is like knowing your left and right hands—it helps a lot!
