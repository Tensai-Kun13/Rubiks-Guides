# 🧩 Once Upon a Cube: A Story of Tiny Cube Citizens

Once upon a time, there was a colorful little cube. But this wasn’t just any cube—it was full of tiny, hardworking cube citizens, each with an important job to do. Let’s meet them!

## 💖 The Core – The Heart of the Cube

Deep inside the cube, hidden where no one can see, lives the **core**. The core is like the cube’s heart. It doesn’t move, but it **holds everything together** and makes sure the other pieces can spin around happily.

## 🎯 Center Pieces – The Calm Kings of Each Side

On each side of the cube, there’s a **center piece**. These are the square pieces that never, ever move from their spot.

No matter how many twists and turns you do, the red center will **always be on the red side**, and the blue center will **always be on the blue side**.

Centers are like the **kings and queens** of their color kingdoms 👑. They stay on their thrones while all the other pieces spin and dance around them.

## 🪢 Edge Pieces – The Colorful Connectors

Next, let’s meet the **edge pieces**. These little rectangles have **two colors**, and they sit between the centers. There are **12 edge pieces** in total.

Edges are like the **bridges** between two color kingdoms 🌉. For example, a red-green edge wants to live between the red king and the green king!

If you mix them up, they get a little confused, but we can always help them get home.

## 🎉 Corner Pieces – The Crazy Color Triangles

Now for the wild ones—the **corner pieces**! These have **three colors**, and there are **8 corners** on the cube.

Corners are full of energy and love to twist and turn! 🎠

A corner with white, red, and green wants to live between the **white**, **red**, and **green** centers. But sometimes they get turned the wrong way—even if they’re in the right place!

Don’t worry—**you’ll learn to help them sit properly** with your cube magic. 🪄

## 🔁 Layers – The Floors of the Cube

Think of the cube like a 3-story building. Each floor is called a **layer**:

- **Top Layer** – the roof, where the yellow pieces usually hang out
- **Middle Layer** – the middle floor, connecting everything together
- **Bottom Layer** – the white floor, where your cube journey begins

You move layers by spinning them like rotating floors—side to side, up and down, around and around!

## 🧙‍♂️✨ And That’s the Cube!

Now that you’ve met all the cube’s little citizens—the kings and queens, the bridges, the twisty corners, and the strong heart inside—you’re ready to help them get back to their homes when they get all mixed up.

Solving the cube is like being a **friendly wizard** 🧙 who brings peace back to the cube kingdom. And with each step, you’ll learn their dances and secret moves to guide them home.
