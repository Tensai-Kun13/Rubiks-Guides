# 📘 Cube Face Names & Move Notation

Now that we know what all the pieces of the Rubik’s Cube are, let’s learn how we **talk about the cube** — like which side is which and how to move them.

## 📦 The Faces of the Cube

Imagine your cube is a tiny house, and you’re always looking through the **red front door**. Here’s how each face is named:

- **Front (F)** — the red face, right in front of you.
- **Top (U for Up)** — the yellow ceiling.
- **Bottom (D for Down)** — the white floor.
- **Right (R)** — the green wall on your right.
- **Left (L)** — the blue wall on your left.
- **Back (B)** — the wall behind the cube that you can’t see unless you spin it around.

We always name moves from the point of view of someone facing the **red front**!

## 🔄 How to Read Cube Moves

When we want you to twist a part of the cube, we use letters like **R**, **U**, **F**, etc. But to make it more fun and easy to follow, we’ll also show you **emoji arrows** to help you see which way the piece turns!

Each face has a normal turn (just the letter) and a **prime** (which means turn the opposite way). Here’s what they all mean:

| Move | Meaning | Emoji |
|------|---------|--------|
| **F** | Turn the front face clockwise (like a doorknob) | ⟳ |
| **F'** | Turn the front face counterclockwise | ⟲ |
| **R** | Turn the right face **upward** | ⬆️ |
| **R'** | Turn the right face **downward** | ⬇️ |
| **L** | Turn the left face **downward** | ⬇️ |
| **L'** | Turn the left face **upward** | ⬆️ |
| **U** | Turn the top face to the **left** | ⬅️ |
| **U'** | Turn the top face to the **right** | ➡️ |
| **D** | Turn the bottom face to the **right** | ➡️ |
| **D'** | Turn the bottom face to the **left** | ⬅️ |
| **B** | Turn the back face counterclockwise (from the front view) | ⟲ |
| **B'** | Turn the back face clockwise (from the front view) | ⟳ |

## ✌️ Double Turns

Sometimes we turn a face **twice** in a row. That’s when we use a **2** after the move:

- **R2** means turn the **right face** two times (180 degrees).
- **F2** means turn the **front face** two times.
- And so on!

Easy peasy!
