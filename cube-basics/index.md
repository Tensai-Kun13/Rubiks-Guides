# 🧠 Cube Basics – Let’s Meet the Magic Cube!

Welcome, young cuber! 👋 Before we start solving puzzles and learning fun moves, we need to **get to know the Rubik’s Cube**.

Think of this as the "getting to know your new best friend" part of the adventure. The cube may look like just a colorful block, but it’s full of little secrets and stories. 🌈✨

In this part of your journey, you’ll explore:

## 🔍 What’s Inside the Cube? (Cube Anatomy)

Your cube has a special body with pieces that twist and turn—but did you know it’s **not just random colors**? Every part of the cube has a job to do!

You’ll meet:
- The *corners* (like the cube’s silly hats),
- The *edges* (like puzzle pieces that love to go in the middle),
- And the *centers* (the calm friends who never move)!

## 💃 How Does the Cube Dance? (Notation + Face Names)

The cube speaks its own language, full of little wiggles and turns. These are called **notation**—fancy word, right?

But don’t worry, it’s super easy! Once you learn what **R** and **U** mean (hint: they’re just directions!), you’ll be doing cube dances like a pro.

You’ll also learn the names of all the cube’s faces, like "Up," "Down," "Front," and more—so you always know where you are.
